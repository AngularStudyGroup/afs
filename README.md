## afs (Angular.js From Scrash)

### Description

afs (aka. Angular.js From Scrash), it's a simple study project for study angular 1 step by step.
We are nerd at JavaScript & Node.js, so Angular.js 2 may not seem like a good choice, because we need to learn TypeScript.
Finally, I decided to aim at Angular.js 1, and the latest LTS version is 1.5.x.

This project would just follow [original official tutorial](https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial/index). Hope you would enjoy it.

Happy learning Angular.js.

### Quick Start

**Setting your environment**

1. Install Node.js LTS (4.x)
2. Install bower. `npm install bower -gd`
3. Install Gulp. `npm install gulp -gd`
4. Initialize our project. `npm install -d` `bower install -d`

> `bower install -d` is not required, this command would be executed by `npm install -d`. Because we have added this command in npm postinstall lifestyle, you can get detailed info by review file `package.json`.
>
> Every time we update dependency, you should execute `npm install -d` to get the project ready to brew.

**Start project**

After everything installed, just type `gulp`. You will see the index page in a new browser window.
